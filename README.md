- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonah Chambers, I am currently a student studying Information Technology Services
- 👀 I’m interested in AI modeling and data engineering for machine learning. I am beginning to work with text and image generative models and trying to build models of my own for certain tasks.
     I love anything that has to do with automation, automating the ordinary and humanizing the extraordinary.
     Outside of programming, I love sports, love playing and watching hockey, and am a football fan. I love anything that has to do with self-health and food as well!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI modeling, and I want to learn and work more with image generation and forecasting. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some fun ideas you might have with what can be automated or can be incorporated into machine learning models. Please give feedback on projects I love to learn.
